# Bullet Journal Webapp 

This repository houses a productivity webapp: a digital bullet journal! It is currently under development using Vue, Flask, and SQLite. 

I've used a bullet journal for many years. I've never seen a digital BuJo! I'm using this as a fun refresh on some webdev skills and am interested in introducing some generative content to my current practice.
